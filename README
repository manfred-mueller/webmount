webmount - Remote FUSE filesystem via server-side PHP script

============================================================

webmount is a FUSE-based filesystem that uses HTTP messages to mount a remote
directory on a local machine, relying on a generated server-side PHP script.

It has been forked from one of the 2 httpfs, which was written by Andrea Cardaci and Emilio Pinna.

Setup
-----

 1. Add the current user to the `fuse` group as described in the **Prepare the
    environment** paragraph.

 2. Install the dependencies. For Slackware based distros install:

        fuse, curl, openssl and cmake

 3. Install:

        make
        sudo make install

 4. If needed, uninstall:

        sudo make uninstall

Sample usage
------------

 1. Generate a PHP script:

        webmount generate php > webmount.php

 2. Place the generated script in an accessible location inside the document
    root of your web server and create a /webmount folder in the servers real root.
    To be on the safe side, adjust the folder's permissions to be read only.
    You can even mount an iso file as loop, as long as it is mounted at /webmount/.

 3. Mount the remote filesystem:

        mkdir /tmp/webmount/
        webmount mount http://target.com/webmount.php /tmp/webmount

 4. Now the remote `/webmount/` is mounted in `/tmp/webmount/`, head there to
    browse the remote files.

 5. Unmount the filesystem:

        fusermount -u /tmp/webmount/

Prepare the environment
-----------------------

Make sure the current user is in the `fuse` group, this preliminary step is
mandatory to use any FUSE filesystem. You can list the groups you belong to with
`groups`, if that includes `fuse` you're done, otherwise:

    sudo adduser john fuse

Then log out and back in or start a new shell with:

    newgrp fuse

to inform the system about the changes.
