"Sample usage\n"
"------------\n"
"\n"
"1. Generate a PHP script:\n"
"\n"
"        webmount generate php > webmount.php\n"
"\n"
"2. Place the generated script in an accessible location inside the document\n"
"   root of your web server and create a /webmount folder in the servers real "
"root.\n"
"   To be on the safe side, adjust the folder's permissions to be read only.\n"
"   You can even mount an iso file as loop, as long as it is mounted at /"
"webmount/.\n"
"\n"
"3. Mount the remote filesystem:\n"
"\n"
"        mkdir /tmp/webmount/\n"
"        webmount mount http://target.com/webmount.php /tmp/webmount\n"
"\n"
"4. Now the remote `/webmount/` is mounted in `/tmp/webmount/`, head there "
"to\n"
"   browse the remote files.\n"
"\n"
"5. Unmount the filesystem:\n"
"\n"
"        fusermount -u /tmp/webmount/\n"
"\n"
"Prepare the environment\n"
"-----------------------\n"
"\n"
"Make sure the current user is in the `fuse` group, this preliminary step is\n"
"mandatory to use any FUSE filesystem. You can list the groups you belong to "
"with\n"
"`groups`, if that includes `fuse` you're done, otherwise:\n"
"\n"
"    sudo adduser john fuse\n"
"\n"
"Then log out and back in or start a new shell with:\n"
"\n"
"newgrp fuse\n"
"\n"
"to inform the system about the changes.\n"
